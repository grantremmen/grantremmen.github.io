I currently hold a joint affiliation as a postdoctoral scholar at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics and as the Fundamental Physics Fellow at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><p>From 2017 to 2020, I was a Miller Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, conducting postdoctoral work in theoretical physics. In 2017, I received my PhD in physics from the California Institute of Technology, where I was a Hertz Fellow and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. While at Caltech, I received the John Stager Stemple Memorial Prize in Physics for outstanding research. I was honored by the American Physical Society with the J. J. and Noriko Sakurai Dissertation Award in Theoretical Particle Physics. My PhD advisors at Caltech were Professor Clifford Cheung and Professor Sean Carroll.</p><p>In 2012, I graduated summa cum laude with high distinction from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities with a triple major B.S. in physics, astrophysics, and mathematics (GPA 4.0). I was named a United States Presidential Scholar in 2008, a Goldwater Scholar in 2010, and received the Chambliss medal for exemplary student research from the American Astronomical Society in 2011. As an undergraduate, I received the Dean's Summer International Student Scholarship from University College London, enabling me to conduct research on multi-body relativistic gravitational systems at Mullard Space Science Laboratory in 2011.</p><p>I was born and raised in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. Growing up, I was always fascinated with physics for its ability to explain the most extreme phenomena of the Universe, from the powerful gravitation of black holes to unraveling the details of the Big Bang. I am pursuing a career in academic research, allowing me to investigate solutions to the most important and fundamental problems in theoretical physics, with applications to astrophysics and cosmology, such as dark matter, dark energy, quantum gravity, and black holes.</p><p>Outside of physics, I am an enthusiastic musician and, with my brother Cole, wrote and composed a two-act Star Trek musical parody called <em><a class="nonblock" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdtBArmWHdY"><span id="u5296-17">Boldly Go!</span></a></em>, which premiered as Caltech’s mainstage production in 2016. At Caltech, I served as a Physics Representative on the Graduate Student Council Board of Directors and Academics Committee. In my youth, I was also an avid aficionado of words and spelling, competing three times in the National Spelling Bee on ESPN.</p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">e-mail: remmen@kitp.ucsb.edu</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://grantremmen.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
